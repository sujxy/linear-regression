basic machine learning models includes:
Regresson models,clustering models and classification model

regression is a type of "supervised learning" method when training set is passed
along with labels accociating with them and goal is to predict a varying result
(not a specific value like regression)

model tries to form a equation consisting of :
independent variables ie, features passed as training set 
dependent variables ie, labels (which is our aim to determine using any set of features)

ex :  y = mx + c
      salary = 3.98*(years of experience) + 2300

once the model has created a generalized equation ,
we can fit our testing data set and predict the results 
which is done by fitting the test set into the general equation 

you can check the accuracy by various methods like R^2

this is my understanding of regression model;
